AttendEase - Attendance Management System

Project by: Ankita Deori and Nayeema N Laskar

Overview

AttendEase is a simple and efficient attendance management system designed for both teachers and students. It streamlines the process of marking and tracking attendance, offering a user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Teachers can mark attendance in real-time, view previous attendance records, and even issue warnings to students falling below 75% attendance. Meanwhile, students can view their attendance, and if absent, submit leave applications directly through the platform.
